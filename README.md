## Welcome to the Bikushi-ushiro wiki!

## Why ?

So first, why did I create this ??

I used to have a Galaxy S2X for almost 7 years. It works like a charm, event if he's a little slow.

The longer I get this phone, the less applications I could use.

Not because it requires top notch new Android feature,  ...

I know that as devs, we should stop maintain old hardware, it's time consuming and really hard.

But we should find solution not to throw away our device every year, the planet can not handle it anyway.

So I've decided to create a small application to get my favorite bike share service in my town.

Under the hood, it's just an API delivering JSON.
(You can find the specs here : https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs)

I'll just add my favorite station and check if there's available docks or bike.

Maybe I will improve it for future users that has a small device like my S2X ðŸ˜¸
