### Welcone !!

Wanna contribute on my small package ??

Wow, you're amazing !!


Here some small step :

1- No direct push to `master`, the coding god does not like it, and will take coffee away from you !

2- To create a PR, please fork the project on your repo, then submit your PR

3- For a PR to be acceptable, you whould run the beautifier / linter and test before

4- Your changed should be covered by test !! (If you are changing types, that's OK)

5- You shou follow the thoughtbot Code Review principle for managing and reply on your PR https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review.
Evil people are not toleate in my home !! :D 

Hmm ... I think it's ok for a first draft !!

If you have some question ... juste make a pull requets or oppen a ticket on this file ;)
